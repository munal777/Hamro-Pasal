# Hamro Pasal - Online Grocery Store (Frontend)

Welcome to the Hamro Pasal repository! This project is a frontend-only implementation of an online grocery store, created as a part of my first-semester coursework. The project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a functional and visually appealing user interface.

Features
Home Page: An introduction to the store with featured products and categories.
Product Listing: Displays a list of available grocery items with descriptions and prices.
Cart Functionality: Allows users to add/remove items from the cart (UI-only; no backend).
Responsive Design: Optimized for various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.


Technologies Used
HTML: To structure the web pages.
CSS: For styling and layout.
JavaScript: To add interactivity and dynamic behavior.
